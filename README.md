Extra random number generators provided by the Rust Random project.
The main repository, [rust-random/rand](https://github.com/rust-random/rand),

This repository houses extra generators maintained by the project.

### Rust version requirements

All crates in this repository require **Rustc version 1.36 or greater**.

GitHub Actions always has a build with a pinned version of Rustc matching the
oldest supported Rust release. The current policy is that this can be updated in
any Rand release if required, but the change must be noted in the changelog.
